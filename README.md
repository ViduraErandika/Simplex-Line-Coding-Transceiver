# Simplex-Line-Coding-Transceiver
To accomplish data transmission between two micro-controllers using twisted pair as the data transmission media. The device should be able to transmit data with length of 1000 bits at minimum of 10 kb/s.

- Device uses Manchester linecoding technique for data transmission.
- Circuits must be entirely analog.
- Algorithm used: Digital Data --> Encoding --> Transmission --> Decoding --> Digital Data
- All the schematics and layouts of the Decoder and Encoder are included in the repo.
